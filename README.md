CarbonRenewed

Abandoned for now. May come back to this when I decide to take a look at either mixins or sun.misc.Unsafe. Polymc (https://theepicblock.github.io/PolyMc/) + Cardboard (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cardboard) currently suits the purposes of this project better.

Fork of NavidK0's Carbon, ported to 1.16. (Some code from Carbon 1.8, some from 2.0)

This is an API for developers to add certain things in Spigot that are normally hard to do.

I will tidy up this README.md later
